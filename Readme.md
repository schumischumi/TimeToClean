This is a PoC for a feature request for the nextcloud-cookbook android app.

The idea is to import a recipe from a picture, extract the title, ingredients and instructions via OCR and format it.
The result can be used as input to add new recipes to the nextcloud cookbook.

Feature request link: https://github.com/lneugebauer/nextcloud-cookbook/issues/141

The debug apk for a quick test can be found in the releases https://github.com/schumischumi/GetRecipe/releases

I tested it on android studio with a pixel 8a VM and my pixel 8a phone as remote debugging device.
